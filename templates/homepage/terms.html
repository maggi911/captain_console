        policies and practices vary widely from country to country. We recommend that you contact your local customs office for
        information.</h6>

    <h6>Please note that when shipping goods from outside of Iceland, cross border shipments may be subject to opening and inspection by
        customs authorities. In respect of all goods dispatched to you to an address outside of Iceland, you are deemed to be the
        importer of the goods and must therefore comply with all the laws and regulations of the country into which the goods are being
        delivered.</h6>

        of your good or provision of the service to you.</h6>

        the option of reconfirming your order at the correct price or cancelling it. If you cancel your order and you have already paid
        for the goods, then you will receive a full refund.</h6>

    <h6>You confirm that the credit card account that is being used is yours. All credit cardholders are subject to validation checks
        and authorisation by the card issuer. If the issuer of your payment card refuses to or does not, for any reason, authorise
        payment to us we will not be liable to you for any delay or non-delivery.</h6>

    <h6>You may only use one discount code with each order. We reserve the right to reject or cancel any orders where you add more than

    <h6>We allow you to use discount codes strictly on the terms and conditions upon which they were issued which, amongst other things,
        may include terms relating to your eligibility to use them and a maximum order value. Discount codes that are valid across the
        entire site exclude pre-orders products, electronics, any products that are valid in multi-buy offers, or items that are
        included in any full sale and/or clearance.</h6>

    <h6>Please familiarise yourself with these terms and conditions before you place an order as we reserve the right to reject or
        cancel any orders which do not comply with these terms even if your credit card has been charged. If there is any inconsistency
        between the terms and conditions upon which the discount codes were issued and these terms and conditions, the discount code
        terms and conditions prevail. A copy of the discount code terms and conditions can be obtained by mailing or telephoning our
